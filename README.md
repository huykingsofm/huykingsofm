### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Huy!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [xybor](https://github.com/xybor) and
[xybor-x](https://github.com/xybor-x).

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Golang projects, especially in
[xybor-x](https://github.com/xybor-x).

âš¡ The projects I'm working on:

-   :memo: [xylog](https://github.com/xybor-x/xylog): leveled and structured
    **logging**, dynamic fields, high performance, zone management, simple
    configuration, and readable syntax.
-   :star: [xycond](https://github.com/xybor-x/xycond): supports to **assert**,
    **expect**, or **testing** with many conditions.
-   :boom: [xyerror](https://github.com/xybor-x/xyerror): supports to define and
    compare **errors** conveniently.
